# Educational LSP 

Exploring the inner workings of the language server protocol. 

## Getting Started

Build the project using ```make build```. Logs are output to the same directory. 

### Register LSP with Nvim 
I've setup my local environment to use this LSP for *.md files. This can be adjusted / changed @ <TODO>
